# Inheritance can be kind of tricky when you are first learning about it, but hopefully after reviewing this material you'll be able to see how valuable and time saving it can be!

- Just like you perhaps have inherited your eye color and hair color, your code can also inherit things from a "parent" object. 

- This is Trevor's [video](https://courses.coderscampus.com/students/courses/274/sections/677/lessons/4835) on inheritance.

- Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs342ePFvRI) using Pete's favorite example, vehicles, car, etc.

- And [here](https://www.baeldung.com/java-inheritance) is another Baeldung page coincidently using vehicle in their explanation as well!

- If you'd like some practice exercises, with built in code solution, and a sandbox IDE to play aournd and learn, you can find one [here](https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/index-inheritance.php).

- And [here](https://javaconceptoftheday.com/java-inheritance-practice-coding-questions/) is another site where there is pre-made code, with small quizzes, errors to find, etc.

- And [this](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/inheritance) also has great info on using the "super" key words in regards to inheritance.


### As we say so often, you can ask chat gpt to explain things to you, for exmple:
### "Please explain what inheritance is in Java, and how and why I'd use it".

### And don't be afraid, if you are working on an exercise or assignment, to reach out to one of the full-stackers for help/explanations.  It's good review for them!
