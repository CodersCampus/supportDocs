# I get a lot of questions about loops, the different kinds, when to use, and how they work, this is an attempt to try to demistify this topic.

- Here are two of Trevor's videos in our course work covering that topic, [if](https://courses.coderscampus.com/students/courses/274/sections/674/lessons/4794), and [Else_if](https://courses.coderscampus.com/students/courses/274/sections/674/lessons/4795).

- Here is also a good [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvWnj_HfG6s) video from Alex Lee (He has some great coding tutorials) on that topic.

- Another great [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6djggrlkHY8), only about 11 minutes long and covers:
    - While
    - Do While
    - For Loops

- Yet another [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs45eeZ326U) that's pretty in depth, fair warning, it's a bit dry, and a little long, but covers: 
    - While Loop
    - Do While Loop
    - For Loop
    - Enhanced For Loop
    - Nested For Loop

    ### This [webpage](https://www.beginwithjava.com/java/loops/questions.html) has a bunch of loop questions, and the coded answers, there is one that is basically the blueprint for assignment 2.

    ### This [webpage](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-for-loop-with-examples/) has great explanations and breakdowns of why loops are used and when to use them, as well as an area to play with pre-built code and practice, as well as some great graphics showing the flow of the code.
