# Customizing your LinkedIn profile is a necessity, and you should be doing it at the start of your bootcamp journey. In this doc, I'm going to walk you through the process of doing just that.

- If you'd like to see mine as an example, you can view it [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karendillehay/)

## Things to note:
- Notice my profile url, there are no trailing letters or numbers, this helps with "SEO" (Search Engine Optimization, or, how easily you will pop up when searched). Here is a quick [youtube](https://youtu.be/OAb-mVPBem8?si=btc5Cwl_pQBeqWvb) of how do to that.  

- It's also important to have a nice profile picture, I don't have professional headshots, I uploaded a few pictures/selfies into an AI generator, it wasn't too spendy, and I think I got about 25 variations. This is a [list](https://www.unite.ai/best-ai-headshot-generators/) of a few different sites that do that.

- Having a good banner is also key, a few people in the bootcamp have hired someone off [fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com).  I used [Canva](https://www.canva.com) to create mine. It doesn't need to be anything too fancy.

- Also make sure you have a nice, succinct "About me" section. I used chat gpt to create mine. I just told it what I was doing, and that I'm a full stack Java dev, and the frameworks and languages I use.

- Also note that I rarely repost anything, only screen shots and recordings. For my recordings, I use [OBS_studio](https://obsproject.com), once I have the video, I edit, trim, and add music with [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com).

- I also use a lot of hashtags, I will literally just google "top 10 hashtags for software developers" and use that as a reference.

- I suggest following companies you are interested in, and when you are looking at those companies, you can search within that company and search things like "java", "software", etc.

- I also have my resume saved to my "featured posts" and my github linked as well.
