# How should I approach the coursework/videos?

You should be actively coding along with Trevor in your own IDE, although when he is using notepad ++, be sure you are using VS code for those videos. Keep in mind you will probably be watching these videos more than once, that’s very normal.

\
**THERE ARE 3 THING TREVOR TALKS ABOUT IN THE COURSEWORK THAT WE NO LONGER USE, SO WATCH BUT DON’T TRY TO REPLICATE:**\
The 3 things are:\
\- JShell.\
\- Notepad ++ (you should be using Visual Studio Code).\
\- Source Tree.\
\*We are removing it, but if you come to a portion that says to “clone the bootcamp repo” disregard this, we no longer do this.__
