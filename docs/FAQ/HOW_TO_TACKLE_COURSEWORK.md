# How should I approach the coursework/videos?

You should be actively coding along with Trevor in your own IDE, although when he is using notepad ++, be sure you are using VS code for those videos. Keep in mind you will probably be watching these videos more than once, that’s very normal.


THERE ARE 3 THING TREVOR TALKS ABOUT IN THE COURSEWORK THAT _**WE NO LONGER USE**_, SO WATCH BUT _**DON’T FOLLOW AS HE INSTRUCTS:**_

The 3 things to NOT USE are:
- JShell. (You will start out using Eclipse!)
- Notepad ++ (you should be using Visual Studio Code for HTML, CSS, JS).
- Source Tree. (You should be using Github Desktop)
