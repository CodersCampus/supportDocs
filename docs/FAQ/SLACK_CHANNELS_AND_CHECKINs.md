# What slack channels do I have access to?
  After your onboarding, you will get added to **Active-Foundations** & **Bootcamp Students** slack channels, you are already in a temporary slack channel just for your cohort (The folks who you onboarded with).Â  These channels are a good place to ask questions, and the Foundations slack channel is where we announce the check-ins, a few minutes before the meeting is scheduled to start, whatever instructor is leading that check-in will post a zoom link everyone clicks to join the meeting. 
  This is what the check in announcements look like:

## Can I join a full stack meeting as a foundations student?

Yes you can, we use the same zoom link for both foundations and full stack check-ins, so if there is a day you want to join a full stack, just find an older check-in link posted in the foundations channel and click that to join. However as a foundations student, you will just be a silent observer in the full stack meetings.
