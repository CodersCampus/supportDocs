- **Who is David Roberts?**\
  David Roberts owns a company called “Crushing Digital”, his job is to help dev’s get a job, he will help you with your resume, git profile, and LinkedIn profile. He is in our slack, I usually recommend reaching out to him after assignment one once you are settled in. You get free access to him, and while it’s not required, I highly suggest working with him. Here is a link to his [**coursework**](https://crushing.digital/#lesson).
