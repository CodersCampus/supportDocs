**Where do I turn in assignments? \*PLEASE WATCH THE VIDEO'S ON GIT BEFORE DOING AN ASSIGNMENT, IT WILL MAKE YOU LIFE MUCH EASIER!**In the bootcamp students slack channel, there is a pinned item at the top called “Assignment submission” from there navigate to the assignment you are looking to turn in, and paste the URL directly from github.com for the repo where you saved that assignment.  There will be an option for “Branch” there is no need to put anything there, perhaps for assignments in full stack but don’t worry about that yet, there is also a comment box, if you have something you wish your reviewer to know about your assignment feel free to add it there but it is not required.****![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/EhAVhKH6YJLo5XV06SHuYZ35MsvayqVtjMfwYat9KpCe-y3IePLF4HY8f4QBxQ1_tmwkowcT-GTdZtXKh-Qmrq-UDxYbeo6KYNpL42D-Ibd462BsR0v_s3wUlC92dsbhTTLuLGan-qEnZtaTtXLtkKs)**\
Where mine says watch review, yours will say “Submit”. Also please note that there are due dates for the assignments on this page.\
