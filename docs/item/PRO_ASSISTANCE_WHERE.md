# Assistance: Where to Ask for Assistance

## From Instructors

If you are asking instructors for assistance:

- Please keep all communications _**within your own thread**_ inside #instructor_guidance
- Please allow a reasonable amount of time. Do not post questions expecting an immediate response.
- Please understand that all instructors are trained to treat you as a professional - meaning we work harder to avoid answering questions with the intention of streching your own skills. Most specifically we try to not just give you an answer, but instead help you learn to increase your resourcing skills for that same type of answer.

# From Other Bootcamp Students

If you are posting your questions for other bootcamp students to answer:

- Trevor prefers all such questions are put in the #bootcamp_students slack channel so that the widest number of interested students can see it.
