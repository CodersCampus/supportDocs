# Is it appropriate for me to reach out to other students vs an instructor?

Absolutely! If there is a student you admire or click with, or just want to know better, it’s always appropriate to reach out to them even if you are in foundations and they are in full stack, it’s a good refresher for them so 9/10 they will help you unless they don’t have time, etc. You can also reach out to another foundations student who is ahead of you.

When you do ask for help, please do so on the computer you have your code on, NOT your phone or another computer. And if you message someone for help, please make sure to have your slack notifications on so if they message you back there isn’t a long delay in your reply.

## What is the 4 hour rule?

If you find yourself stuck in your code, spend 4 hours trying to fix it yourself, this means googling different things, looking on stack overflow (which will most likely pop up in your google searches), Chat GPT, re-watch the coursework video’s a few times, etc.
So spend 4 hours researching before you reach out for help on the slack channels, or messaging an instructor on slack, this doesn’t exactly apply to the check-in’s, if you are stuck and there is a meeting in and hour and half, bring it and we’ll help you.

## What are some good resources during this 4 hours you are stuck?

This is the most critical skill you will learn during this bootcamp!

You will have to get good at researching on your own when you are stuck. Even once you are working, there is no way you are going to be able to memorize everything to do with coding. Googling, asking Chat GPT, Claude AI, looking on Stack Overflow (kind of like Reddit for devs), looking at YouTube videos, and REWATCHING the coursework videos are just jumping off points.
