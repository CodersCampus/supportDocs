# Team - Pairing Mode

Professional coders have long recognized that there are few better ways to get to the top of the profession than pairing with the best coder you can find to pair with.

## Checkins and LiveCoding

Try to go to enough checkins to act as coder at least a dozen or two times before you graduate. 

This can mean a lot of checkins, because more often than not, you will be watching someone else code, rather than being one of the active coders.
