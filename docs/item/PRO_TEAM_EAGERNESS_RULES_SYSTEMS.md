# Team - Conventions, Rules, Systems

Professionals, such as coders, are often governed by more rules and conventions than would apply to less professionally oriented jobs.

## Your responsibilities in CodersCampus

Noone is expected to know Conventions, Rules, and Systems coming into the bootcamp.

EVERY professional on graduation from this bootcamp is expected to have sought out and learned as many Conventions, Rules, and Systems as reasonable, over the period of time that he/she is a professional in this environment.

## Eagerness

Nothing referenced in this document will be forced on you. You must seek it all out from your own sense of eagerness. 

Those who are not eager to learn these will simply not become top professionals. This is a sad fact of how professional careers are, and are not, built.

## Conventions

Professions such as coding are almost always built from layers and layers of conventional behaviors added on top of each other, decade after decade.

Conventions are the glue that hold us all together. It is what allows us to work together as teams.

We go to dozens of checkins, just to learn these conventions, and to see them in operation.

We rely on these conventions as a "soft" kind of guide - knowing that if we follow them, we can fit in on any similar team, and contribute in a productive manner.

## Rules

Everything said about Conventions above is also true of Rules, just that rules are applied in a harder, or more stringent fashion.

If it is conventional to usually follow ... convention for package naming, it is a rule, not a convention, that a java type always starts with a capital letter.

As a professional coder you are expected to know certain rules.

# Systems 

Systems can be tools, platforms, setups, processes, anything. But professionals know them all as one thing - a way that they get their job done.

As a professional at CodersCampus you are expected to learn and leverage systems such as git, the Agile Development environment, languages and libraries, etc.

This is not something you will be spoon fed. Professionals seek these systems out because they need them.
