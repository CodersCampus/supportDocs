# Professional Deference to Other Professional's Time

Professionals have invested a massive amount of their own time in their professional skills. So they are the first to recognize that same thing in others.

One rule of thumb is to be extremely respectful of the time of any pro. They might be generous, or they might not - but that should be their option. 

## Treat other professionals as if every second of their time matters.

Professionals are in high demand. Even if they look calm and collected, they may have many people waiting on them at any given point in time.
