# Instructor's Suggestions for Using AI During Bootcamp

## TL;DR

We recommend **limiting AI usage** during the bootcamp assignments (especially A6–A14) and **avoiding AI-assisted IDEs** like Cursor until your final project or later.

Using AI can be an amazing tool for learning — but overusing it too early may rob you of key foundational skills.

## So… Can I Use AI?

Short answer: **Yes, but very wisely**.

Here’s how to get the most out of AI *without* stalling your progress:

### ✅ DO use AI to:
- **Ask questions about small code blocks** you wrote yourself.
- **Request explanations** of concepts you’ve encountered but don’t fully understand (e.g., “What does this error mean?” or “Why does this `forEach` loop behave this way?”)
- **Compare different approaches** after you've attempted a solution.
- **Debrief** after a coding session. Ask the AI to review a solution you already wrote and explain what could be improved.

### ❌ DON'T use AI to:
- Write your whole assignment.
- Build files or full programs from scratch.
- Bypass an error without understanding it.
- Copy/paste solutions that you haven’t reasoned through on your own.

## 🚫 Why Not Use AI-IDEs Like Cursor Early On?

AI-powered IDEs like **Cursor** are powerful, but that’s the problem.

If you rely on them during early assignments, you’ll likely:
- Skip writing the code yourself.
- Avoid debugging (a key learning experience).
- Miss out on the patterns and repetition that build real understanding.

We strongly suggest **saving Cursor for your final project** or using it *after* you've built core muscle memory on your own.

## Think of AI as a Tutor, Not a Crutch

During A6–A14, you're developing foundational skills: 
- Navigating syntax
- Structuring logic
- Understanding flow
- Debugging your own work

Let AI be your **study buddy**, not your driver.

> “Box it in.”  
> Use AI in a limited, intentional way that supports your thinking, not replaces it.

## Sample Use of AI

```text
❌ “Write a program that does X, Y, Z for Assignment 7.”

✅ “Here’s a JUnit method for Assignment 7. Can you explain what it’s doing and whether it handles all edge cases?”
```

## 🎯 Our Goal Is Your Growth

We want you to:
- Build real skills.
- Be able to explain your code.
- Graduate with confidence, not just working code.

So be curious. Ask questions. But code with your own brain first. Then turn to AI as a way to deepen your understanding.
