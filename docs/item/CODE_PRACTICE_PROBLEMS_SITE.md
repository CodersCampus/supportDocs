[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), and [Edabit](https://edabit.com/)

LeetCode and HackerRank are valuable resources for programmers, software engineers, and individuals preparing for technical interviews. They offer a structured way to practice and improve coding skills by solving real-world problems and challenges while tracking your continued progress. Many tech companies also use platforms like these to assess the coding proficiency of job candidates during the hiring process.Â  While those two sites are more widely known, Edabit is also a great way to start working on code challenges/problems, and testing yourself. However I found that Edabit was a little more beginner friendly.
