# Implementing Guardrails in Cursor IDE

> Your project should look like something *you* would actually build and can explain. Guardrails keep the vibe-coding from getting out of control.  

> With the right guardrails in place, you create a productive rhythm:  
> ✅ No out-of-control suggestions or complexity 
> ✅ A working relationship that *just clicks*  
> ✅ Faster, cleaner, more educational coding  
>  
> Set the rails → then let momentum do the rest.



This guide outlines how to set up intelligent guardrails in [Cursor](https://www.cursor.sh/) using custom rule files (`.mdc`) and a `.cursor-config` file. It also includes tips for using Cursor’s `Ask` feature to **learn while building**.

## Step 1: Create Your Rule Files

Guardrails are implemented using **MDC rule files**. These guide the AI to respond according to your project's stack, style, and expectations.  
You can click the ⚙️ Settings cog in the top-right corner and go to **Rules** from there. There are **User Rules** (global) and **Project Rules** (per repo). You don’t need to set both. Just pick what fits your workflow.  

I recommend storing your rule content in `.mdc` files inside your project (e.g., `.cursor/java-rules.mdc`) and referencing it in your `.cursor-config`. This way, your rules are version-controlled, reusable, and can be shared.  
Once linked, you don’t need to paste rule text into Cursor’s settings. The config does the work.


Example structure:

```
📁 .cursor/
└── java-rules.mdc
```

### Sample: `java-rules.mdc`

```mdc
Your expertise is in Java and Spring Boot.
You prefer JPA/Hibernate for ORM and Thymeleaf or React for views.
Avoid introducing unnecessary complexity unless asked.

Never scaffold an entire app; give short examples or just the method or class needed.

You should:
- Assume the project is full-stack unless told otherwise.
- Prioritize clarity and brevity.
- Guide like a peer mentor, not a senior architect.
```

> You can create multiple `.mdc` files if you work across different languages or tech stacks.

## Step 2: Configure `.cursor-config`

This JSON config file maps your rule files to your **user** and/or **project** scopes.

### Sample: `.cursor-config`

```json
{
  "user": {
    "rules": ["java-rules.mdc"]
  },
  "project": {
    "rules": ["java-rules.mdc"]
  }
}
```

 Place this file in the **root of your project**.

## Step 3: Use `Ask` to Learn as You Code

Cursor’s **Ask** sidebar is more than just a Q&A box — it's a teaching tool.

### Use it to:
- Dive into new tech: _“Explain Spring’s `@Transactional`”_
- Compare choices: _“Should I use JPA or raw SQL for this query?”_
- Scaffold boilerplate: _“Write a Spring controller for a Student entity”_

### 👥 Tip:
Use **Ask like a teammate**, not a search engine. You're here to build _and_ learn.

## Why Guardrails?

| Benefit            | Why It Matters                                                |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Consistency      | Responses match your tech stack and coding style = the project resembles something you'd build on your own!            |
| ✅ Clarity          | Avoids bloated or off-topic answers = This is where vibe coding gets out of control.                          |
| ✅ Speed            | You waste less time fixing or rewriting suggestions = When you have the right guardrails, you land on a great working relationship.         |
| ✅ Better learning  | You stay in your project’s context while growing your skills  |

> _Guardrails let the AI work **with** you—not ahead of you._

## Summary

| Tool               | Purpose                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `.mdc` files        | Define how AI should behave/respond      |
| `.cursor-config`    | Link rule files to user and project scope|
| `Ask` feature       | Learn contextually while staying productive|
