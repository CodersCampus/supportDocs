Tech interviews for dev positions typically involve a combination of technical questions, coding challenges, and discussions about your experience and projects. I did a doc on how to prep, find it [here](../item/HOW_TO_PREP_FOR_TECH_INTERVIEW.md).

Here are some key aspects you can expect in tech interviews:

1. Technical Questions:

   - Interviewers may ask you questions related to Java programming concepts, such as object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, algorithms, multithreading, and collections.
   - They may also ask about web development concepts, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and front-end frameworks like React or Angular.
   - Be prepared to discuss database concepts (e.g., SQL, NoSQL), RESTful APIs, and server-side technologies like Spring or Hibernate.
   - Questions about software design patterns, architecture, and best practices are also common.

2. Coding Challenges:

   - Many interviews include coding challenges where you'll be asked to solve a problem or implement a specific functionality.
   - These challenges can range from simple algorithmic problems to more complex scenarios involving data manipulation or web development tasks.
   - You may be asked to write code on a whiteboard, on a computer, or through an online coding platform.
   - Be prepared to explain your thought process, discuss time and space complexity, and optimize your code if required.

3. Project Discussion:

   - Interviewers may ask about your previous projects or experiences related to full-stack Java development.
   - Be ready to discuss the technologies you used, the challenges you faced, and how you solved them.
   - They may ask about your role in the projects, your contributions, and the lessons you learned.

4. Problem-Solving and Communication:

   - Interviewers often assess your problem-solving abilities and how you approach complex issues.
   - They may present hypothetical scenarios or real-world problems and ask how you would tackle them.
   - Clear communication is crucial. Explain your thoughts and ideas effectively, ask clarifying questions if needed, and be open to feedback and suggestions.

5. Behavioral Questions:

   - In addition to technical skills, interviewers may ask behavioral questions to assess your soft skills, such as teamwork, communication, and adaptability.
   - They may inquire about your experience working in a team, handling conflicts, or dealing with tight deadlines.
   - Be prepared to provide specific examples from your past experiences that demonstrate your skills and abilities.

To prepare for tech interviews, consider the following:

- Brush up on your Java and web development knowledge, focusing on core concepts and best practices.
- Practice coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeChef to improve your problem-solving skills.
- Review your past projects and be ready to discuss them in detail, highlighting your contributions and the technologies used.
- Prepare examples of how you have tackled complex problems or collaborated with teams in previous roles.
- Stay updated with the latest trends and advancements in the Java ecosystem and web development.
- Practice communication skills and be able to articulate your thoughts clearly and concisely.

Remember, tech interviews are an opportunity for you to showcase your skills, knowledge, and experience. Be confident, honest, and enthusiastic about your work. Show your willingness to learn and adapt, and demonstrate your passion for full-stack Java development.

Good luck with your job search and interviews!
