# No Screen Shots of Code Allowed for Assistance?

When asking questions about coding assignments and exercises, non-professional coders will often share screen shots.

CodersCampus _**instructors disallow such screen shots of code**_ for questions that are asked of instructors, and also strongly discourage same when you are asking other students for help.

This may make no sense, to the noob. Here's why.

## Why?

There are so very many reasons, more than we will enumerate here.

1. It is faster. I can `git clone` and run code in my IDE in less than a minute. It takes me that long just to focus my eyes on the code in your screen shot.
2. If I can't compile and run your code, I don't know what else might be causing issues.
3. Your screenshot might reference code that is not showing. 
4. This saves me from asking a long string of back and forth questions before understanding what it is that your code does.
5. I use the IDE for a lot of things that I might want to look at, in your code.

But mainly it's just #1 above. It's many times faster, overall.

## Why You Might Prefer Screenshots?

The biggest reason you might prefer screen shots is that your git skills may not be up to par. Such as, not knowing [proper project setup](../item/PRO_ASSISTANCE_PROJECT_REPO_DIRECTORY.md) or even [how to ask questions](../item/PRO_ASSISTANCE_QUESTIONS_LOCALIZED.md)

Yup.

These are great reasons for not sending that screenshot. Take the time now to learn the basics. Your question can wait.
