# No Screen Shots of Code Allowed for Assistance?

When asking questions about coding assignments and exercises, non-professional coders will often share screen shots.

CodersCampus _**instructors disallow such screen shots of code**_ for questions that are asked of instructors, and also strongly discourage same when you are asking other students for help.

This may make no sense, to the noob. Here's why we do this.

## Why?

There are so very many reasons, more than we will enumerate here.

1. It is faster. I can `git clone` and run your code in my IDE in less than a minute. It takes me that long just to focus my eyes on the code in your screen shot and try to get enough context in your code to figure out what you are trying to do.
2. If I can't compile and run your code, I don't know what else might be causing issues.
3. Your screenshot might reference code that is not showing. 
4. This saves me from asking a long string of back and forth questions before understanding what it is that your code does.
5. I use the IDE for a lot of things that I might want to look at, in your code.

But mainly it's just #1 above. It's many times faster, overall, to have access to the whole project exactly as it runs on your box.

Faster means I get to focus on helping you, rather than just trying to understand what it was you were asking me in the first place.

## Why You Might Prefer Screenshots?

The biggest reason you might prefer screen shots is that your git skills may not be up to par. Or even, not knowing [proper project setup](../item/PRO_ASSISTANCE_PROJECT_REPO_DIRECTORY.md) or even [how to ask questions](../item/PRO_ASSISTANCE_QUESTIONS_LOCALIZED.md)

Yup. We get it.

These are great reasons for you, for preferring to just send that screenshot. That's why you need to take the time now, to learn the basics. 

Your question can wait, until you get it committed and pushed to github.
