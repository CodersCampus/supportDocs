# Start RIGHT NOW preparing to get that job!

As soon as you finish the first assignment, please contact David Roberts and get started on his coursework for finding a job as a developer.

## Who is David Roberts?

David Roberts operates as “Crushing Digital”. His job is to help dev’s get a job, he will help you with your resume, git profile, and LinkedIn profile. 

He is in our slack, I usually recommend reaching out to him after assignment one once you are settled in. You get FREE access to him as a member of the bootcamp!!!!, and while technically not required, I highly suggest working with him unless you are just taking the bootcamp for a way to pass the time :). 

David Roberts is here to make sure you are prepared to take it all the way, and get a job.

Here is a link to his [**coursework**](https://crushing.digital/#lesson).
