# Responsiveness is Your First Obligation as a Professional

Professionals often speak of their careers as "Golden Handcuffs".

How does that relate to your need to be responsive?

## You are expected to respond in a timely way to instructors.

- Instructors are your surrogates for a superior while you are here.
- You are also expected to respond to administrative staff in a timely fashion.

## What does this mean, in practical terms?

- You are expected to have the slack app on your phone
- This slack app is to be logged into the coderscampus slack feed
- Your notifications are to be turned on
- You will be getting notifications if a slack message is sent to you

In practical terms, this will often feel annoying. This is one of the curses of being a professional, it often feels annoying to be held responsible as a professional.

## Why? You are here as a professional. Think "responsive"

The day you join the bootcamp, you are signing on to become a professional.

Professionals are responsive. That's why they are paid well, that's why they are respected.

It is OK for professionals to feel slightly resentful of the responsibilities that come with the good fortune of having a profession. That's why they sometimes mock their own paychecks as Golden Handcuffs.

Could be worse. Some don't have a profession to be resentful about.
