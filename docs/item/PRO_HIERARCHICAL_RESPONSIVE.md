# Responsiveness is Your First Obligation as a Professional

Professionals often speak of their careers as "Golden Handcuffs".

How does that relate to your need to be responsive?

## You are here as a professional. Think "responsive"

The day you join the bootcamp, you are signing on to become a professional.

Professionals are responsive. That's why they are paid well, that's why they are respected.

It is OK for professionals to feel slightly resentful of the responsibilities that come with the good fortune of having a profession. That's why they sometimes mock their own paychecks as Golden Handcuffs.

The flip side is, some don't have a profession to be resentful about.

## You are expected to respond in a timely way to instructors.

- Instructors are your surrogates for a superior, while you are here.
- You are also expected to respond to administrative staff in a timely fashion.
