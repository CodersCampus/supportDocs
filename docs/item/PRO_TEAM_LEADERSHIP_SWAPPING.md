# Team - Leadership Swapping

Professionals learn to swap leadership roles early in their careers.

## Do I want to be a leader?

Hah! Maybe you didn't know that professionalism and leadership go together like hand and glove.

If you are a professional, that is akin to being a leader. Else, you're just a worker. 

The flip side is that if you just want to be a worker, without leadership responsibilities, you may find that AI replaces you more quickly than you might guess.

So treat your career like a profession. Take a leadership role. Relish the responsibility.

## Swapping

Any leader will tell you that it can be fun at times, but it can also be a pain in the butt.

So you learn to swap responsibilities back and forth between other leaders.

Learn to this as quickly as you can. Never take a leadership role unless theirs a matching leader or leaders to swap responsiblities back and forth with.
