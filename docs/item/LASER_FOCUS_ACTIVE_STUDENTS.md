# 🎯 Focused on the Finish Line: Our Commitment to Active Students

We are laser-focused on one goal:  
**Helping our active students get hired.**  
End of conversation. Full stop. No other distractions.

## ✅ What Does “Active” Mean?

To be considered an active student, you must maintain some combination of:

- Attend check-in meetings to hold yourself accountable
- Get assignments done
- Make progress on David Robert's checklists
- Do CP checklists as they become available
- Engage with the community (Slack, meetings, etc.)

We can’t say how much progress you need to make at any given time.
But what we WILL do is focus our efforts on those who are making visible progress. If we can’t see any progress, we will simply drop you off the active-full-stack channel and let you go your own way until you want to become active again. 

If you're putting in the work, we’re here to match that energy and help you cross the finish line.

## 🧹 Cleaning Up Channels

We’ll be streamlining and cleaning up Slack channels to focus on **active students only**. This allows us to concentrate our support where it matters most.

## 📋 Personalized Job Checklist
