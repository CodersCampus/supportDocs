# 🎯 Focused on the Finish Line: Our Commitment to Active Students

We are laser-focused on one goal:  
**Helping our active students get hired.**  
End of conversation. Full stop. No other distractions.

## ✅ What Does “Active” Mean?

To be considered an active student, you must:

- Attend check-in meetings
- Reach out to **Miriam** for support when needed
- Engage with the community (Slack, meetings, etc.)

If you're putting in the work, we’re here to match that energy and help you cross the finish line.

## 🧹 Cleaning Up Channels

We’ll be streamlining and cleaning up Slack channels to focus on **active students only**. This allows us to concentrate our support where it matters most.

---

## 📋 Personalized Job Checklist

We’ll be reaching out to each student individually with a **checklist of next steps** to help guide your job search process.

➡️ **Miriam** will follow up via DM to ensure everyone has what they need and is supported through the checklist.

Let’s do this. Together.
