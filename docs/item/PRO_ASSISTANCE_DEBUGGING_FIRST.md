# Please Run Your Code In Debugger Before Asking for Assistance

Instructors will sometimes get requests for help, and then learn that the code has never even been run in the debugger before requesting help.

## Your attendance at checkins assures that you can act as a professional with the debugger

Sometimes the professional requesting help has not gained confidence with the debugger.

As a fellow professional, you would probably mentor your friend to attend checkins more frequently, and force the issue of learning the debugger better in checkin coding sessions.

Getting the reputation for asking for help from others before first investing their own time in your professional debugging skills, may be something a professional would wish to avoid.
