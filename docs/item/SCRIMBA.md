[Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/dashboard#overview) is an interactive online learning platform that focuses on teaching coding and web development skills. They have interactive coding screencasts, hands on learning environments where you can code along with an instructor, courses, and practice projects with some pre-built code, that you can see altered in real time.  They also have a YouTube channel and podcast, although I haven't checked those out. Once you click the above link, just scroll to the bottom of the page to find the free courses and menu of other things they offer.
