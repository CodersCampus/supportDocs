### As always, for tips far more in depth than this, message David Roberts in our slack (we get free access to his coursework and office hours, that are similar to our check-ins but just job search oreinted), but for a brief starter:

- Before you apply anywhere, find that company on LinkedIn and follow them, you can search for keywords within a company under the "people" section.  I usually search with the words "Java", "Developer", "Full Stack", etc.  Follow all of them,, if they only have the immediate option to "Connect", don't do that, as it can be percieved as a little intrusive. Insead click on the 3 dots or the "more" option next to where it says "Connect", and that will open up an option to "Follow".  I personally, if I'm interested in that company and have done my research, will then send a short message to that person and say "Hi there! just wanted to say I think what your doing at compay xyz is awesome!", or "I really thought it was cool that you did this....(put whatever is applicable), or "I thought it was amazing how your company handled....(again whatever is applicable)". I personally (Karen typing this), avoid saying things like "I'm a new dev looking for a job" and things of that nature, these people probably get many of those types of messages a day, I get those sometimes, and they feel abrasive/offputting. Again that is just me. 

- I then do that same type of search within that company for "Recruiter", "Human Resources", etc. Follow those people as well.

- Really look into a company that fits with your goals/ideals, and if you like that company:
    - Make a copy of your resume, and customize it to fit what they are looking for, mentions thier company name, and structure your resume to fit what they are looking for.
    - Make a copy of your cover letter, and do the same thing, customize it so it shows off your skills, the ones they were looking for in thier job posting (of even if they don't have a posting, a lot of places have an "open application" section, or just straight up message someone in HR and explain in a polite, proffessional way why you are emailing them directly.)

## MAKE   SURE  YOU  FOLLOW  UP!!!!!!

- Keep track of where you have applied, with notes, you can do this in an Excel spreadsheet, or you can use something like [Notion](https://www.notion.so) to keep track of this. This is what I use, they have many, many different services/templates. I use it for all my calendar as well, as you can integrate many different ones from google, etc. 

- After you've applied, wait 2 days , then follow up, then wait 3 days after that, follow up. Then wait 4 days after that, etc. etc. until you get some kind of reply, people get busy, so remind them of who you are/why you applied/why you think you'd be a good fit.

## BE WARY OF SCAMS!

- Sadly, there are some fake job posting out there, in some cases these are "Resume Farms", the "employer" will use the information on your resume, and sell it.  Or the employment posting might be a straight up phishing scam.  Please use your best judgement, research the company name, and if you have a gut feeling, or there are "red flags", hesitate on applying.  If you aren't sure, reach out to one of your bootcamp instructors and run it by them.
