A good computer set-up will make your life a lot easier, whether or not you are using laptop or pc, I highly suggest getting a second monitor, so you can watch videos and code at the same time, rather than flipping back and forth on one screen, which is annoying and very time consuming. I got mine for about $45 U.S. from [NewEgg](https://www.newegg.com/). I like buying from them because they give your gift cards for future purchases, or if you have a compatible TV you aren’t using you just need an appropriate video connection (such as HDMI) but keep in mind that if you are connecting via VGA, you will need an adapter in order to do so.
   -If you are using a laptop, I also suggest getting:\
   - A bluetooth keyboard ([mine](https://www.newegg.com/logitech-mx-keys-s-bluetooth-and-usb-wireless/p/N82E16823126718), fancy, you get far less expensive ones that are fine)
   - A bluetooth mouse, [here](https://www.newegg.com/logitech-910-006556/p/N82E16826197551) is the one I got (this is a fancy one, you don’t need one that fancy)
   - optional, but a docking station is helpful [here](https://www.newegg.com/wavlink-umd04-gray/p/1DN-0023-00055?Item=9SIA6PFCV27974\&cm_sp=SD-_-2382375-_-Pers_ProductSponsoredDisplay+2382381-_-9-_-9SIA6PFCV27974-_-9SIA6PFDD52884-_--_-1) is the one I bought
   - optional but might save your neck, a laptop riser, here is [mine](https://www.newegg.com/p/0VE-000W-00048)
   - also optional, but a nice big mouse pad that you can set your keyboard and mouse on are nice, they have some with built- in charging docks and LED strips, like mine ([this one](https://www.newegg.com/p/173-0861-00005?Item=9SIBFJ5J9C4077\&cm_sp=SP-_-1533763-_-0-_-0-_-9SIBFJ5J9C4077-_-large%20mousepad-_-large%7Cmousepad-_-4) is quite similar to what I have), and many other options.
   NewEgg also has a lot of sales, and combo buy options, like if you wanted the exact keyboard and mouse I got, they have [that option](https://www.newegg.com/logitech-mx-keys-s-combo-usb-wireless/p/N82E16823126717).
  - Also if you decide to get a bluetooth keyboard, there are a lot of small “mini” keyboards you can get if you will be using it outside your house.
  - If you wanna go down a hole and want to spend a lot of money, there are endless tiktoks, insta stories, and youtube vids on tech setups. But there are some [like this one](https://youtu.be/TTI6rLXrRtA?si=Zhr4Bq1SDCtUHFcB), that have suggestions for an affordable, neat setup.
