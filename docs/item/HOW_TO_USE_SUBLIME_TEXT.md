# Why should I use sublime text?

Sublime Text is a text and code editor that you can use in IntelliJ to get things done a lot faster when you are editing a template.

With Sublime Text, you can:
-Edit text in multiple places at once
-Automatically select the same text throughout a file
-Copy and paste lines that are spread out from one another

## Enabling Sublime Text in IntelliJ

You first need to select the options/settings dropdown at the top right side of the screen. From this dropdown you will select the keymap option.

Once you do this a screen should appear in the middle of the screen, from which you will select Sublime Text.

<img style="border-radius: 10px" width="400" alt="GitHub Desktop default" src="../images/Sublime2.PNG">

Once selected, Sublime Text will be eneabled.

3. Control + double click allows for selecting multiple chunks of text

Here are a few examples of how this can be used:
