It can be very daunting when you sit down to start working on your resume, luckily, this day in age there are MANY tools out there to help you with this. One thing to keep in the forefront of your mind before you start is ATS.  ATS stands for “Applicant Tracking System”.  Most companies use ATS.  This is computer software that helps companies manage the hiring process by sorting through and organising applications. When you apply for a job, your resume typically goes directly into an ATS database. [This](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-resume/#:~:text=ATS%20stands%20for%20%E2%80%9Capplicant%20tracking,directly%20into%20an%20ATS%20database.) webpage has a great breakdown of what this is and how it works, as well as a short YouTube video with explanation. Essentially you want to build a resume that will make it past ATS so your resume actually gets in front of a human. \
