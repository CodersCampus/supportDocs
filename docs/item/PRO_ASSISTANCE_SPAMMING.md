# Assistance Spamming

One of the most infuriating moments of any instructor's life is to spend 45 minutes researching a problem for a student - not uncommon - only for the student to respond "Oh, I asked Bob, he already answered that for me".

This is reputational death for the would-be-professional. That student will be blacklisted in that instructor's mind for months.

You would think that it rarely happens, but instead it happens all the time. This is one of the primary motives for why we moved all questions to a common, public, thread.

## Don't let this be you

Treat your reputation as a professional as your most valuable asset.

When others blacklist you because you unintentionally wasted their time - they may not even be conscious of their own feelings. They know that they will never help you again but can't even remember why.
