# Assistance Spamming

One of the most frustrating moments of any instructor's life is to spend 45 minutes researching a problem for a student - not uncommon - only for the student to respond "Oh, I asked Bob, he already answered that for me".

This is reputational death for the would-be-professional. That student will be remembered as discourteous and non-professional in that instructor's mind, for months.

You would think that this rarely happens, but instead it happens all the time. This is one of the primary motivators moving all #instructor-guidance questions to a common, public, thread.

## Don't let this be you

Treat your reputation as a professional as your most valuable asset.

When others feel motivated to never help you again because you (unintentionally) wasted their time previously - they may not even be conscious of the cause for their own feeling. They carry that feeling inside, but often can't even remember why.
