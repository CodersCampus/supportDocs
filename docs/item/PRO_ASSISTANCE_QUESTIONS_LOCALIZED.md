# Professionals Ask Specific Localized Questions

You may observe that humans, generally, tend to be very poor at mind-reading. 

This can be a real problem for the would-be-professional who is looking for some code assistance, asking for help by submitting a code repository, with the generalized statement "This is where I need some help."

It happens more often than you might guess.

## Always mention exactly which file to look for the problem

Please use a very exact path from the root of the repository.

## Always mention exactly which line in that file

"Line 27, where I am ..."

## Always explain exactly what you are expecting, and what is happening instead.

"I expected this to return a result of ..."

"And instead, it is ..."

## Always provide a story of the process you already used to eliminate as many of the problems as possible.

- What steps?
- What were the results?
- What did you see in the debugger?
- etc
