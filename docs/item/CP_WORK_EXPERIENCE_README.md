# Work Experience Team Guidelines 

## About
We need structure, so we started making rules for ourselves to give us a chance to stay organized.

Please read everything on this page as a guideline even if says "must" or "shall" ... because here's the deal. Our first principle is we gotta
be flexible and kind to each other and give each other plenty of slack if we want to succeed as a team.

So the main rule is stick to what matters, and use the rules/guidelines below as best as you can.

## What Matters?

1. This program is **_for its participants_** - those students who are giving their time up to contribute, in exchange for the chance to claim employment on their resume. Never lose sight of our single objective - to help them look good and have experience to get that job that they are looking for!
2. We serve all checkin attendees! Students invest their valuable time in a checkin - we are here to make this investment pay off for them. Everything we do should support this investment, else why even do it?
3. The `cp` app is a goal by itself. This app is here for the use of all students. We should always prioritize our efforts to maximize value in the app. We should always prioritize our tickets and efforts on those tickets, accordingly.

## Always Evolving

Everything you see here, as well as what we do in the checkins themselves, is always evolving. Sometimes we will even change things in practice, and forget to note changes on this document itself :)

## Ticket Ownership
Tickets shall always be owned by one of the leads on the Work Experience team and must adhere to the following guidelines:
1. Tickets are always **owned by Product Owner: Bianconi first** until explicitly handed off to another lead.
2. The next owner will ensure **100% clarity** before taking ownership. There needs to be a clean handoff in both directions. 

## Meeting and Work Allocation
- **Meeting Roles:**
  - Every meeting ideally will have at least **one lead present** (not the Product Owner, but a developer).
  - Leads will sign up at the beginning of every week in the `#leads-cp` channel to indicate which meetings they will attend.

- **Work Division:**
  - Some **coding** tasks can be completed **outside the meeting**. Others will be completed inside the meeting. There is no right or wrong way to do that. However, there is one rule:
  - The **Pull Request (PR)** and **Code Review processes** will be conducted **during the meeting**.

## Communication and Terminology
- The `#leads-cp` channel is designated for communication within the Work Experience team.
- Every member of the Work Experience team will be referred to as a **“lead”**.
