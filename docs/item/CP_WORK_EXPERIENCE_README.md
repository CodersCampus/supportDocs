# Work Experience Team Guidelines 

## Ticket Ownership
Tickets shall always be owned by one of the leads on the Work Experience team and must adhere to the following guidelines:
1. Tickets are always **owned by Product Owner: Bianconi first** until explicitly handed off to another lead.
2. The next owner must ensure **100% clarity** before taking ownership.

## Meeting and Work Allocation
- **Meeting Roles:**
  - Every meeting must have at least **one lead present** (not the Product Owner, but a developer).
  - Leads should sign up at the beginning of every week in the `#leads-cp` channel to indicate which meetings they will attend.

- **Work Division:**
  - All **coding** tasks should be completed **outside the meeting**.
  - The **Pull Request (PR)** and **Code Review processes** will be conducted **during the meeting**.

## Team Priorities
1. The **Work Experience team members** are the first obligation.
2. Equally important is providing support to **students not yet at the Work Experience level**.

## Communication and Terminology
- The `#leads-cp` channel is designated for communication within the Work Experience team.
- Every member of the Work Experience team shall be referred to as a **“lead”**.
