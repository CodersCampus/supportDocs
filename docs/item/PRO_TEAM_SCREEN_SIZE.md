# Your Screen Share Might Look Unprofessional to a Laptop User

Anybody can share a screen, zoom makes that easy. Right? 

But ... it takes a little bit more skill to make it easy for the laptop on the receiving end, to read your screen.

## How to Make Your Screen Readable on Their Laptop?

TL;DR: The 3 minute demo might be the easy way.

## The Mathematical Explanation

Here is what really happens, if we look at this as professionals.

- One professional might be on a laptop with screen resolution as low as 1920 x 1080
- Another professional might be sharing from a desktop screen with resolution as high as 3840 x 2160
- If the guy with 3840 wide screen
    - has good eyes 
    - and thus 10pt text 
    - and shares 
    - and the guy who has bad eyes 
    - and a 1920 wide screen 
    - and then zoom eats some portion of the screen anyway
    - then the guy with bad eyes viewing on the laptop is essentially reading 3 point text with bad eyes.
    - Yeah, that doesn't work.
    - And the guy who is sharing jokes "heh, looks great on my screen."

## What is the remedy?

There are many remedies, but two groups of remedies stand out. 

But first, it really is up to others to speak up. If someone is being a knucklehead narcissist and sharing a huge screen, they should at least be informed of what they are doing to others, even if unintentionally.

### Increase Type Size

This is a simple command in IntelliJ, for example. But it still isn't my favorite approach. Does work, though.

### zoom > screen sharing > advanced > custom screen size

What i do is _**Always share a very small part of one screen, never a whole screen**_

This has the advantage of working for every app, not just your coding app. Fit each app into the appropriately sized zoom window, and come across as courteous to every viewer. 

No fuss, no muss, no bother.

## How to do this, professionally

1. Start your own zoom session with yourself
2. Practice different ways of sharing your screen for 5-10 minutes
3. You are now better prepared to share your screen with skill and courtesy
