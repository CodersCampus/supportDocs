# You can customize your git profile, by editing your readme.md.

-If you'd like to see mine as a reference you can find it [here](https://github.com/Kadillehay).
- I just realized some of the code I was references for this is no longer available so isn't rendering correctly, I'll fix that soon.

- Again, like LinkedIn, have a nice profile picture, I used an AI generated headshot, you can find more info about that in the LinkedIn doc. [This](https://www.unite.ai/best-ai-headshot-generators/) is a list of AI sites that can do that for you.

- You'll also see that I have a website connected to mine, not a necessity, but if you have a profile webiste, you can link it there.

- I also have my LinkedIn connected to that, I would call that a necessity.

- There are a ton of cool options for a great profile readme, you can find a huge list of options [here](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme?tab=readme-ov-file#code-mode-).

NOTE: THE ABOVE IS A SLIGHTLY HARDER OPTION AS YOU WILL HAVE TO ACTUALLY MANIPULATE THE CODE, THE LINK BELOW LEADS TO THE FAR EASIER OPTION, JUST DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH CUSTOMIZATION YOU'D LIKE.

- This [video](https://youtu.be/ktN5tDfQ_g8?si=EQKODJ9AS7vATGUq) is a good walkthrough on how to customize, and shows a few other websites where you can get this auto-generated if you don't want to mess with the actual code., he starts at minute 6. Using the site he uses which is [profileMe](https://www.profileme.dev)
is MUCH easier than altering the readme yourself. I didn't know that site existed when I did mine, so I might actuall go back and use that site.
