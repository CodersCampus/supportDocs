Other than customizing your git profile, which I cover here to have it more personalized, there are also some other changes you do to make it easier for recruiters/other devs. To navigate, and set yourself apart.\
-Pinning your latest/best projects, this is similar to the “featured" section of your LinkedIn, it just highlights them.\
-Adding a descriptive README, these are like instructions for how to use your project/what it does. (Chat gpt does a good job making these for you if you tell it what your project is).\
-You can add “Descriptors” . These are kind of like hashtags on social media.  You can simply start typing something like “java” and it will fill in the rest of the word for you.\
-Have a descriptive name for your project aka your assignments.  After your assignment has been submitted and accepted, go back and change the name of the repo.\
In the below picture, I’ve highlighted things in pink, purple, and light blue. Where you see the “User Validation with CSV file” that just my assignment 3, renamed.  And the light blue and purple are just the “description” and “topics” options from Git.

The below picture with arrow is the settings gear icon to add either the description tags, or topics tags, or both if you like. In that picture you can also see my readme.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/h2CEycFDRAs5P86hKxF9yaK4a-2plx7hKRtllYKY_uncxWWx17RofWQemDlCA1JwAAdKqvC2jfQUALX60hrRtVh7uIkkFbYhw2EHwICOd3VwxwRJoA4tAg1fzMTiTrgqYnfgbnAMFO0GPOnIQMeqi84)

And this is the window that pops up when you pick your description and topics, and website if you have it.\
