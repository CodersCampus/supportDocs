As you go through the bootcamp you might hear the word "microservices" what is that?

Imagine you have a big Java application that does many different things. Instead of building it as one giant piece of software, you can break it down into smaller, independent parts called microservices.

   Each microservice is like a small, separate application that focuses on doing one specific task really well. For example, you could have a microservice for handling user authentication, another for processing orders, and another for generating reports.

   These microservices work together to make the whole application function, but they can be developed, updated, and run independently. It's like having a team of specialists working together, where each specialist has their own skills and can work on their own tasks without interfering with others.

   Microservices talk to each other using simple, standard ways of communication, like sending messages over the internet. They can be written using different Java technologies and frameworks that suit their specific needs.

   The main benefits of using microservices in Java projects are:

   Flexibility: Each microservice can be updated or changed without affecting the entire application.

   Scalability: If one microservice gets a lot of traffic, you can easily add more copies of it to handle the load without scaling everything else.

   Resilience: If one microservice has a problem, it won't bring down the whole application. Other microservices can still work normally.

   Technology freedom: Different microservices can use different Java technologies that are best suited for their specific tasks.

   However, building microservices also comes with some challenges. You need to handle communication between microservices, ensure data consistency, and manage the deployment and running of multiple services.

   In Java projects, developers use special frameworks and tools like Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, or Dropwizard to make building and managing microservices easier. They also follow best practices to design, test, and monitor microservices effectively.

   Overall, microservices help make Java applications more flexible, scalable, and maintainable by breaking them down into smaller, independent parts that work together.
