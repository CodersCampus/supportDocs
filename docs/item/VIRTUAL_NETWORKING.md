There are other ways to network if, like me, you don't live in a tech dense area. The following are things I've enjoyed doing/platforms I've had luck on, other than LinkedIn of course.

1. \- [Meetup.com](http://meetup.com):

   Meetup.com is a popular platform for finding and attending local tech events, workshops, and conferences.Search for meetups related to your specific interests, such as Java, web development, or data science.Attending meetups allows you to connect with other developers, learn from expert speakers, and stay updated with the latest industry trends.Many meetups also provide opportunities for networking, job seeking, and collaborating on projects.

   -[Discord](https://discord.com):

   While I used to use it primarily for gaming related stuff, Discord is a platform that has gained popularity among developers and tech communities.There are numerous Discord servers focused on various programming languages, frameworks, and technologies. Join relevant Discord and engage in discussions, ask questions, and learn from experienced developers.Some popular Discord servers for developers include:

   [CodeNewbie](https://community.codenewbie.org/t/discord): A community for new and aspiring programmers to learn and connect.

   [The Coding Den](https://discord.com/invite/code): A server for general programming discussions and peer support.

   [JavaScript.info](https://discord.do/javascript-info/): A server focused on JavaScript and related technologies.

   -[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/):

   Twitch is primarily known as a live streaming platform for gaming, but it has also gained traction among developers.Many developers stream their coding sessions, tutorials, and project work on Twitch. Follow and interact with developers who stream content related to their interests. You can ask questions, learn from the streamer's experience, and connect with other viewers who share similar interests.

   Some popular tech streamers on Twitch include:

   [ThePrimeagen](https://www.twitch.tv/theprimeagen): Streams about JavaScript, TypeScript, and web development. Also if you're all about serving up democracy, he steams himself playing Helldivers once in awhile as well.

   [Theo](https://m.twitch.tv/theo/home): Focuses on Python, machine learning, and data science.

   [Coding Garden with CJ](https://www.twitch.tv/codinggarden): Streams about various web development technologies.

   Online Communities and Forums:

   -Platforms like [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) have subreddits dedicated to programming, such as r/learnprogramming, r/webdev, and r/java,even a r/codingbootcamp!  where developers share knowledge and engage in discussions.

   -[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a popular Q\&A platform where developers can ask questions, provide answers, and learn from the community.Other online communities include [Dev.to](http://dev.to), [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/), and [freeCodeCamp Forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/), which provide platforms for developers to write articles, share ideas, and connect with peers.

   -Open Source Contributions:

   Explore and contribute to open source projects on platforms like GitHub.Contributing to open source allows you to collaborate with other developers, learn from code reviews, and build your portfolio.  You can start by finding beginner-friendly issues or projects that align with your skills and interests. Open source contributions not only enhance your technical skills but also provide opportunities for networking and building connections with maintainers and other contributors.

   -Tech Conferences and Workshops:

   Attend tech conferences and workshops, either in-person or online.Conferences provide opportunities to learn from industry experts, attend workshops, and network with professionals.

   Many conferences also have dedicated networking sessions or social events where attendees can connect and exchange ideas.

   \- Some popular tech conferences include [JavaOne](https://www.oracle.com/javaone/), [Google I/O](https://io.google/), [Microsoft Build](https://news.microsoft.com/build-2023), and[ AWS re:Invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/).

   Remember the importance of active participation, asking questions, and being open to learning from others. Networking is a two-way street,offer help, share your knowledge, and contribute to the community.

   Building a strong professional network takes time and effort, but it can lead to valuable connections, job opportunities, and personal growth in the long run.
