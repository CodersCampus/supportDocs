# Tips from Alex Mamolo

## TL;DR: 

1. 
This [whole Practice Beginner Stuff repo](https://github.com/amamolo9986/Practice-BeginnerStuff.git) could be helpful before Assignment 3, or see deeper explanation below.

2. 
If you want the "best tips ever" on how to get through the hard part of foundations, you really need to skip the TL;DR and instead scan through the helpful links at the bottom of this page.

Else, [here is her Final Project presentation which has a ton of great tips sprinkled throughout](https://youtu.be/GlbLbRR77vc)

## Helpful Leading Up to Assignment 3

Alex Mamolo shares a collection of beginner exercise examples that are invaluable for understanding core Java concepts. These exercises are designed to bridge the gap towards mastering Assignment 3 by focusing on practical application and understanding.

**Key Highlights Include:**

- **POJOs, Arrays, and Looping Exercises:** Learn the nuances between hard coding users into an array and dynamically adding them via loops. A clear comparison is drawn by showcasing how to output an array directly versus using a loop for both addition and display (`System.out.println`).

- **Method Utilization in Java:** Explore the versatility of methods through Alex's 2nd assignment, recreated with varying types of method calls. This part of the exercises demonstrates how methods can interact within and across multiple classes, providing a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming.

- **Structured Learning:** Each concept is meticulously organized into separate packages for ease of navigation and learning. Every package includes its own `main` method, allowing for standalone execution and practice.

For direct access to these exercises and to start enhancing your Java skills, visit Alex's GitHub repository:

Leverage these exercises to solidify your understanding and pave the way for success in Assignment 3 and beyond.

## [Alec's Final Project Presentation (includes tips)](https://youtu.be/GlbLbRR77vc)

Alex's Final Project presentation was great, but when the questions started rolling in, she started answering a lot of them about _**how she got through the coursework**_, especially foundations.

Below is a sampling of some of those most helfpul tips.

- [Start here for *why she repeated assignments 2-4 until she really got it*](https://youtu.be/GlbLbRR77vc?feature=shared&t=111)

- [Start here for *how she felt about backtracking to assignment 2-4*](https://youtu.be/GlbLbRR77vc?feature=shared&t=295)

- [Start here for *how long it took her to build her final vs. how long it took to do assignment 3*](https://youtu.be/GlbLbRR77vc?feature=shared&t=1321)

- [Start here for her explaining *why she thinks the first half of the bootcamp is harder*](https://youtu.be/GlbLbRR77vc?feature=shared&t=1355)

- [Start here for how mac FreeForm helped her *organize her final project*](https://youtu.be/GlbLbRR77vc?feature=shared&t=1526)

- [Start here for her *deliberate process* with coursework, not downloading the code Trevor has available, rather taking notes and coding every single line along with the videos. Also she saved every single thing in her IDE to reference *or use* as she progressed](https://youtu.be/GlbLbRR77vc?feature=shared&t=2010)

- [Start here for how she took different exercises from the coursework and did them again from scratch with her own variables to increase her learning around methods and constructors](https://youtu.be/GlbLbRR77vc?feature=shared&t=2440)

- [Start here for how Pete figured out to create the Drills for repetition -> muscle memory](https://youtu.be/GlbLbRR77vc?feature=shared&t=2605)

- [Start here for how she handled the perenial question "Do I have the ability to become a coder". Hint: quitting was not an option](https://youtu.be/GlbLbRR77vc?feature=shared&t=2903)

- Start here for how a buddy can help -> **find a buddy that you can hate this with**
