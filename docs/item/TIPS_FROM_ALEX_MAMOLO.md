# Tips from Alex Mamolo

## TL;DR: 

1. 
This [whole Practice Beginner Stuff repo](https://github.com/amamolo9986/Practice-BeginnerStuff.git) could be helpful before Assignment 3, or see deeper explanation below.

2. 
If you want the "best tips ever" on how to get through the hard part of foundations, you really need to skip the TL;DR and instead scan through the helpful links at the bottom of this page.

Else, [here is her Final Project presentation which has a ton of great tips sprinkled throughout](https://youtu.be/GlbLbRR77vc)

## Helpful Leading Up to Assignment 3

Alex Mamolo shares a collection of beginner exercise examples that are invaluable for understanding core Java concepts. These exercises are designed to bridge the gap towards mastering Assignment 3 by focusing on practical application and understanding.

**Key Highlights Include:**

- **POJOs, Arrays, and Looping Exercises:** Learn the nuances between hard coding users into an array and dynamically adding them via loops. A clear comparison is drawn by showcasing how to output an array directly versus using a loop for both addition and display (`System.out.println`).

- **Method Utilization in Java:** Explore the versatility of methods through Alex's 2nd assignment, recreated with varying types of method calls. This part of the exercises demonstrates how methods can interact within and across multiple classes, providing a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming.

- **Structured Learning:** Each concept is meticulously organized into separate packages for ease of navigation and learning. Every package includes its own `main` method, allowing for standalone execution and practice.

For direct access to these exercises and to start enhancing your Java skills, visit Alex's GitHub repository:

Leverage these exercises to solidify your understanding and pave the way for success in Assignment 3 and beyond.

## [Alec's Final Project Presentation (includes tips)](https://youtu.be/GlbLbRR77vc)

Alex's Final Project presentation was great, but when the questions started rolling in, she started answering a lot of them about _**how she got through the coursework**_, especially foundations.

Below is a sampling of some of those most helfpul tips.

- Start here for *why she repeated assignments 2-4 until she really got it*
