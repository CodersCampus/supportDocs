### Helpful Leading Up to Assignment 3

Alex Mamolo shares a collection of beginner exercise examples that are invaluable for understanding core Java concepts. These exercises are designed to bridge the gap towards mastering Assignment 3 by focusing on practical application and understanding.

**Key Highlights Include:**

- **POJOs, Arrays, and Looping Exercises:** Learn the nuances between hard coding users into an array and dynamically adding them via loops. A clear comparison is drawn by showcasing how to output an array directly versus using a loop for both addition and display (`System.out.println`).

- **Method Utilization in Java:** Explore the versatility of methods through Alex's 2nd assignment, recreated with varying types of method calls. This part of the exercises demonstrates how methods can interact within and across multiple classes, providing a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming.

- **Structured Learning:** Each concept is meticulously organized into separate packages for ease of navigation and learning. Every package includes its own `main` method, allowing for standalone execution and practice.
