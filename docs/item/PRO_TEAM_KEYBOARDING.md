# Team - Keyboarding

Professional coders are professionals at the keyboard.

I tell everyone who will listen. If you are using a mouse at your coding interview when your interviewers are expecting you to use your keyboard, they won't say a thing. They will just hire the other guy, without a single explanation why.

Learn keyboarding skills for at least 25-50 normal coding operations that you could also do with a mouse.

Not necessarily in order

- copy
- paste
- cut
- format
- save
- delete line
- move line
- comment out block of code
- show methods available for ...
- ...

These are just examples. Build your muscle memory from the first day at the bootcamp. Put your mouse in the next room, if that's what it takes.

## Checkins!!!!

If you want to see some really amazing keyboarding, come to plenty of checkins.

If you want to suffer through some cringe-level keyboarding, come to plenty of checkins.

Nothing will motivate you to be a better keyboarder than LiveCoding at checkins.
