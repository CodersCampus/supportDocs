# Team - Boundaries and Playfulness

Professionals use opposite ends of the same toolsets to manage the more difficult human issues in their career.

## Boundaries and Emotional Intelligence

Professionals often have to learn more about a field called "Emotional Intelligence" to learn how to deal with humans better.

Don't forget! Our primary skill is with code and maybe less so with humans!

For this reason, it is totally appropriate to seek out help from other professionals on how to deal with human issues we may feel less capable with.

It is OK to not be an expert in this area, but it is probably not professional to be over-confident when instead it is better to seek out the advice of people who can help us act in a more professional manner

## Playfulness

One thing that does happen when we are more at ease with our own profession is that we can be just ever so playful when appropriate.

This can be seen in the context of regulars at our checkins. The regulars are often playful at unexpected moments.
