# What happens if I fall behind?

- If you are only one or two assignments behind, the hard truth is you will probably have to spend more time grinding on your code to get caught up.

- The reason this can be a big deal is because, if you remain behind, it heightens the chances of you not graduating within your contract time. If you have questions on your specific contract please reach out to Irish Morales on slack. 


## Inactive Status & Time Watch Status  

- The best discipline is ALWAYS internal. A professional, guided by thier own high expectations of self, are 10x better equipped than any tool that collects data. 

- But if you are behind, and the internal professional motivation isn't doing the trick, you're going to have to show us you are working on the courework in order to remain active. You will officially be in Time Watch status. The way you show us your progress and committment is with the Work Log below.

If you fall behind in the bootcamp, you may be marked as **inactive**. Here's what that means and how you can regain your active status.

### What Does Inactive Status Mean?

- **Slack Channel Removal**: Inactive students are removed from the active Slack channels: **Active Foundations** and **Active Bootcamp Students**. This means:
  - You won't see posts or updates in these channels.
  - You won't have access to meeting links shared in these channels.
- **Access to Coursework**: You will still have access to all coursework materials and assignments. However, the lack of updates and community support may impact your progress.
- **Limited Support**: While inactive, you won't receive the same level of support and engagement as active students. It’s crucial to become active again to maximize your learning experience.

### How to Regain Active Status

To regain your active status, you need to submit **Work Logs** to show progress. This log should include:

- **Minutes Spent on Coursework**: Track the time you spend on each unit and assignment. This may include outside learning. Most likely it will show you've been working on a particular assignment for however long. 
- **Bootcamp-Related Activities**: Include any other activities related to the bootcamp, such as drills, exercises, or additional learning resources.

Regularly submitting your Work Log will demonstrate your commitment and help you transition back to active status.

## Time Watch Status (Avoiding Inactive Status)

If you are on the verge of becoming inactive, you will be in Time Watch status. You can take steps to remain active:

- **Read This Document**: Understand the expectations and requirements to maintain active status.
- **Submit Work Logs Regularly**: Make it a habit to log and submit your work as frequently as you engage with the bootcamp materials. This shows continuous effort and engagement.

Staying active ensures you remain connected with your peers and instructors, receive timely support, and make the most of your bootcamp journey.

## Additional comments


- Along with just putting more time into your code, attending meetings/check-ins (for which we track attendance), will help you not only get caught up, but will give you glimpses at assignments you will have to do in the future, and see where people get hung up in those assignment, which will help you avoid those hangups.

- If you use all of your resources (the coursework, YouTube, Stack overflow, google, Chat GPT, Gemini & Claude), as well as come to the check-in meetings, your chances of getting caught up are far greater.  

- If you are concerned that you will fall behind due to a life event, or simply not moving at as fast a pace as you thought you might, please reach out to Pete Carapetyan, Irish Morales, or myself (Miriam Law) via slack.

- THERE IS ZERO JUDGMENT IF YOU FALL BEHIND! We just want to rally behind you to do what we can to get you caught up, graduated, and employed.
