**What happens if I fall behind?**

-If you are only one or two assignments behind, the hard truth is, you will probably just have to spend more time grinding on your code to try to get caught up\
-The reason this is a big deal is because if you remain behind, it heightens the chances of you not graduating within your contract time (and everyone’s contracts are different, if you have questions on your specific contract please reach out to Irish Morales on slack). \
-Along with just putting more time into your code, attending meetings/check-ins (for which we track attendance), will help you not only get caught up, but will give you glimpses at assignments you will have to do in the future, and see where people get hung up in those assignment, which will help you avoid those hangups.\
-If you use all of your resources (the coursework, YouTube, Stack overflow, google, Chat GPT, Gemini (similar to chat gpt). As well as come to the check-in’s, Your chances of getting caught up are far greater.  If you are concerned that you will fall behind do to a life event, or simply not moving at as fast a pace as you thought you might PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE reach out to an Pete Carapetyan, Irish Morales, or myself (Karen Dillehay) via slack!\
-THERE IS ZERO JUDGMENT IF YOU FALL BEHIND! We just want to rally behind you to do what we can to get you caught up, graduated, and employed!!
