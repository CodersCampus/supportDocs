# 2025 Scheduling Changes

Changes outside of this bootcamp are causing students to show up to empty or almost empty checkins, neither of which is a positive situation for some or all students.

Our first principle is to serve our students, so if our checkins are not working for them, we need to fix that, no matter what caused the problem. Fortunately, the fix is relatively easy.

## What Causes Empty Checkins

#### External

- Our enrollment has dropped by approximately 75% in less than a year
- AI has created uncertainty in our market.

#### Internal

- Our extremely successful and well received Work Experience program has also siphoned off a modest amount of checkin attendance.

## Projected Pool of Active 2025 Full Stack Students

- Feb - 12 active full-stackers
- Mar - 10 active full-stackers
- Apr - 9 active full-stackers
- May - 7 active full-stackers
- Jun - 6 active full-stackers
- Jul - 5 active full-stackers
- Aug - 6 active full-stackers
- Sep - 6 active full-stackers
- Oct - 6 active full-stackers
- Nov - 8 active full-stackers
- Dec - 7 active full-stackers

Projections are always wrong, but if these are even in the ballpark, this is too few meetings to support 7 fullstack checkins a week, going by what our students prefer.

The math: 7 students attending 1.5 checkins is an average attendance of 1.5 for 7 checkins. Most students don't want to be the only one at any checkin.

## The Remedy - Sign Ups for all but 3 Scheduled Checkins

1. Our 3 most popular checkins remain as scheduled, Mon & Wed night, Thurs afternoon
2. Other scheduled checkins remain also - but only if students sign up in advance.
3. The minimum size is negotiated - some do, some don't want to be the only student at a meeting.

Using this approach, we can still give you everything you came to Coders Campus for - but without the fear of showing up for some checkin where you're the only one there.

The most likely result will be that meetings will drop to 3 or 4 per week, but we'll still have all 7 if there is demand for same.

## Process - 24 hour Sign-up Window

1. All signups are just casual discussions on #active-fullstack - just say what you want for the week
2. **Signups happen between Sunday noon and Monday noon CST**
3. Schedule for the week is posted in #active-fullstack at 1pm CST Mondays

Sign-ups only required for these 4 low attendance meetings (else cancelled individually):

- Mon AM
- Tues
- Wed AM
- Fri AM

We are very few in number so this is a relaxed approach - no database, no forms, no apps just a few of us working it out weekly, in advance, on slack.

Repeating for emphasis: _**Ask for what you need. We're here to serve,**_ our principles have not and will not change.

## Other Changes?

Since our system is going to be flexible anyway, you can also propose different checkin times. We still have to work within instructor's schedules, but if it's a change that accomodates enough students, we're open to considering it!
