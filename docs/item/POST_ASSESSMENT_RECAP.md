**POST ASSESSMENT RECAP DOC:**

**Do I have to attend onboarding?**

**YES.**  This is a mandatory start to your bootcamp journey.  You must be at the computer you

used for your assessment, not on your phone, not out in public in a noisy environment, etc. 

Please ensure your audio and camera are working, as you must have your camera on, just like

your assessment.  

We pride ourselves in providing a very flexible bootcamp schedule in every reasonable way. ONBOARDING IS AN EXCEPTION!\
There is **no flexibility in your onboarding attendance**. Period, the end.

**What is onboarding exactly?**

Pete Carapetyan (our lead instructor) and Karen Dillehay (Software Engineer for Student

Support) lead onboarding, we will go over how to structure your day of coding, how to tackle

assignments, where and how to turn in assignments, etc. Basically how to set yourself up for

success.

**How do I attend onboarding?**

You’ll get an automated email with the zoom link, date, and time of your onboarding,just click the

link a minute or two before we are scheduled to start.

**When will I get access to course work?**

Immediately after onboarding, you’ll get an automated email with a link to the course work.

After onboarding you’ll also get added to two additional slack channels, “Active-foundations”

(Every one assignment 5 and below is in this channel) and “Bootcamp Students” (Every student

in the whole bootcamp is in this channel). In both channels, there are also all the instructors, as

well as Trevor Page.

 **How do I attend check ins?**

In the foundations slack channel, just before the meeting begins, the instructor who will be     leading that check in will post a zoom link that everyone will click to join.\
You can start attending check-ins after you onboard.\
**What happens during check in?**Every student will take about 30 to 60 seconds, say what they are working on, if they are stuck on anything, etc.  After all students have done their check in, if anyone is stuck, or has a blocker, they can share their screen and as a group we help them get through the blocker.\
_Please note on your bootcamp calendar, every two weeks, at the Wednesday morning check-in,_ [**_Trevor Page_**](mailto:trevor@coderscampus.com)**_(founder of the bootcamp) is our honored guest!_** __Feel free to come to this check in with questions, these are a lot of fun, and everyone's invited!

**Can I attend Full Stack meetings as a foundations student?**

Yes! This is encouraged! But by no means required. Not only will you get a preview of the assignments to come, and how to tackle them, see common blockers etc., you’ll get to meet the more advanced students, some of whom you’ll be in full stack with once you turn in assignment 5, you can also potentially find a “mentor”, this can either happen organically, if you just click with someone, or if you are interested in being set up with someone, please message either Pete or Karen, and we will find a willing full stack student.\
**When should I ask for help?**We have a “4 hour rule”, once you have worked on your issue for 4 hours, and have tried googling, looking on stack overflow (a forum for devs to post issues and answers), chat gpt, etc. Then you have the ok to either reach out to an instructor (Pete Carapetyan, Ogulcan Kendirci, Tyler Micelli, or Karen Dillehay) or you can take a screenshot and post to the foundations slack channel. If you have been going to any of the Full Stack meetings and are comfortable asking one of those Full Stack students, it's a good opportunity for review for students. For example, if you are having trouble with your IDE (Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, whatever you happen to be using) this would be ok to post to the “bootcamp students” channel, essentially, please try to keep assignment specific questions to “foundations channel”, and anything of a more broad topic to the “bootcamp students” slack channel.

**Who do I contact for more admin related/non-coding bootcamp questions?**
Irish Morales is your admin who handles your non-coding related issues.  Just shoot her a message on slack.

Please note Irish lives in a remote time zone, so if you don’t hear back immediately, please be patient.

**What happens if I don’t finish all my assignments within my bootcamp contract period?**

If you have been regularly attending check-ins, and making a true effort in the bootcamp, it will be up to the leadership group to offer you an extension, for a monthly fee. This can get expensive! So we greatly advise against falling behind. Please reach out to Irish Morales if you are getting to the end of your bootcamp contract time and feel like you might be in this position.

**What happens if I have a major life event during the bootcamp?**
Sometimes a major life event (death in the family, traumatic accident, etc) happens to one of our students. Every such situation is then evaluated individually, and depends upon the performance of the student up to that point. For example, if you have regularly attended check-ins, worked diligently on assignments etc, there exists the possibility of “pausing” your contract, so you do not fall behind. In such a situation, please contact Irish Morales, and Karen Dillehay, we will then take your case to the bootcamp leadership for evaluation.\
\*Please note this is not a guarantee, and will go on a student by student basis, and may look different for every student.  We will not make any of your situation public in any way, and you will have complete confidentiality.

**Who is David Roberts?** 
David Roberts is someone services Trevor has paid for, so we have full access to him,and his full courses. He will help with your LinkedIn, Resume, Git profiles etc.  I would suggest looking at some of his reviews of others, on his LinkedIn, to get a better idea of what it is he is able to help you with, here is a link to his [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidproberts/). Just scroll through his profile to find some of his review videos. After assignment 1 or 2, when you are settled in at the bootcamp, reach out to him, he is on our slack so you can DM him.\
&#x20;    \*Please note he lives in England so he may not ping you back immediately.\
**\*While it is optional, it’s suggested that you have the Slack app on your phone, it makes communication easier, and can be helpful for check-in reminders.**

**If you have any questions please reach out to either Pete Carapetyan or Karen Dillehay**
