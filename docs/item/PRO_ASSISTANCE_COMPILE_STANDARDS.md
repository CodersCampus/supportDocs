# Your Code MUST Compile Before Asking for Assistance

Never ever ever ask anyone to look at your code if it does not compile.

## When to remove compile errors from your code

Compile errors should never be seen in your IDE's code window for more than 10 seconds. As soon as you see a compile error, you should fix that line.

If you change something that breaks the compile in other areas, fix ALL of those breakages instantly. Do not code for a while and then fix them later.

Professionals do not code with compile errors in their code window. All other work stops until code compiles.

## What if I submit code that doesn't compile for assistance?

All instructors and all students are asked to please not help anyone at any time for any reason if their code is not already compiling.

## Is there an exception to this rule?

When are compile errors accepted?

If you are in your first day or two of coding in your java IDE, and you have never coded before, then you may or may not be eligble for a lesson in how to keep your code compiling.

For the most part, your IDE will always tell you if your code doesn't compile. It will usually give you suggestions on options that are available that DO compile.
