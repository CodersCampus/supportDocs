# Ticket Selection Guidelines

## Purpose

The purpose of these guidelines is to streamline the process of filtering and prioritizing tickets for the team. By following this structured approach, we ensure that the most impactful, actionable, and well-defined tickets are addressed first, optimizing both the development workflow and the user experience.

## Guidelines

### 1. First Sort By:
- **What is most useful**: Prioritize tickets that will provide the greatest value to the project or users.

### 2. Then Filter By:
- **Is it doable?**: Ensure the ticket is feasible given the team's resources and current priorities.
- **Do we have someone assigned to it?**: Confirm that there is a team member available and capable of working on the ticket.
- **Has it been adequately defined?**: Verify that the ticket is clearly written and includes all necessary details.
  - **Done**: A ticket is considered adequately defined when it has clear objectives, acceptance criteria, and any required context or dependencies.

### 3. If the Ticket Passes the Above Filters:
- **Add to the "On Deck" label**: Include the ticket in the queue for immediate or upcoming attention.

### 4. Subfilter:
- **UI Consideration**: If anyone has to explain how to use the UI, the ticket raises in importance. Addressing such tickets improves usability and reduces the need for explanations.

By following these guidelines, the team can effectively prioritize their work and focus on delivering meaningful, high-quality results.
