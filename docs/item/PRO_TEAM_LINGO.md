# Team - Lingo

Professionals always have to learn the lingo.

- Every team has it's own lingo
- Every profession has it's own lingo
- Every company has it's own lingo
- Most leaders have their own lingo

It's your job to come to enough checkins to at least get a solid vocabulary going.

It won't always be the right vocabulary for the next next team. But once you learn the idea for one environment, the next one may be similar enough to learn fast.
